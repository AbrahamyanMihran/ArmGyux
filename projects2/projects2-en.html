                After forty-four days of the war, due to the loss of territorial integrity in Artsakh, problems arose with agriculture. The most important factor in life was the construction of small greenhouse complexes. The project is presented to your attention. With an area of 300 sq.m. the construction of which will provide jobs for about 7 people and will affect the progression of food production, since we will purchase everything necessary for construction from Artsakh and Armenia.
                Already in the finished complex 2 people can work. The complex can provide eco products, vegetables, meat, eggs, milk.
                <br><br>
                <span> 2. Description of the complex and purpose of use. </span><br>
                The complex consists of parallel tunnel-type greenhouses 5m wide, 2.8m high, 20m long,  behind which there is a small farm 2m wide, 2.8m high and 15m long. The front and back parts of the complex are covered with 8mm cellular polycarbonate. The boards are also covered with cellular polycarbonates 1m high. The remaining parts are covered by agrospam. And you can also cover the top with plastic wrap in the winter.
                A heating device is installed with the rear structure. Nests are being built for 20 chickens, 25 ducks and a barn is constructed for 2 goats. It is noteworthy that the gas exhaled by animals contributes to the photosynthesis of plants, and manure is used as fertilizer. Surplus vegetable crops grown in greenhouses are used as food for the birds and animals, which makes up about 40% of their food. This type of complex will allow the user to additionally produce eggs, poultry meat, goat meat and milk at a relatively low cost.
                The complex is heated by a developed device that runs on wood or gas, heated air is distributed through special pipes throughout the complex and heats it up. In 3 greenhouses of the complex with 90 m2., you can grow any vegetables and herbs.
                The proposed new method of cultivation allows you to build a greenhouse on any soil cover, which is an important circumstance. The program also includes training for the staff of the complex.<br><br>
